I'm a second year Ph.D. student studying Computer Science at <a href='https://cs.brown.edu/'>Brown University<a>, advised by <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis<a>. I received my master degree from <a href='https://www.bu.edu/cs/'>Boston University<a> and my undergraduate degree from <a href='https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en'>Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen<a>. I was also a Production Engineer intern in the Kernel Team at Meta during summer 2022.

Broadly, my research interests are interpretability and fairness in computer systems. I enjoy working on system/software/automation hybrid space either improving the underlying systems to achieve higher scalability & performance & security, or offering system support for various applications. Currently I'm working on microservice causal profiling and Pash serverless extension.
